# **Predicting BIM for Eiffage Constructions**
Machine Learning Project - Le Wagon Bootcamp

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to **predict Building Information Modeling (BIM) outcomes** for **Eiffage Constructions**, a leading construction company in France. By analyzing construction data, material properties.

## **Motivation**
BIM plays a crucial role in modern construction, enabling **better planning, reduced costs, and improved collaboration**. Predicting BIM attributes accurately can enhance **decision-making**, improve resource allocation, and drive **innovation** within Eiffage's projects.

## **Project Goals**


## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of historical construction projects, passed by Eiffage Constructions

## **Technology Stack**
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
🔹 TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning models
🔹 XGBoost & LightGBM for boosting algorithms
🔹 Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis
🔹 Streamlit for interactive visualization
🔹 Git & GitHub for version control

## **Installation**
To set up the environment, run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fqbq69/BIMpredict-.git
cd BIMpredict
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**
Train and evaluate the model with:
```sh
python train_model.py
python evaluate_model.py
```
